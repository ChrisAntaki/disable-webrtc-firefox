Disable WebRTC, for Firefox
========================

[Install here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/happy-bonobo-disable-webrtc/)

WebRTC is a communication protocol that relies on JavaScript that can leak your actual IP address from behind your VPN, by default. This addon fixes that, making VPNs more effective [1].

This add-on allows you to easily disable WebRTC. You'll also be able to quickly toggle WebRTC back on/off by clicking the add-on's icon.

NOTE: Disabling WebRTC will break some web applications, like Google Hangouts. Firefox can't disable WebRTC per-tab or per-window, the setting affects the entire browser. You can easily toggle WebRTC on/off by clicking this add-on's icon. If that doesn't work for you, [karlbright@](https://github.com/ChrisAntaki/disable-webrtc-firefox/issues/27#issuecomment-393377906)'s advice might: "the best solution for the foreseeable future is to either have another browser (perhaps firefox developer edition without this extension) used for those services, or enable WebRTC, and disable it again once finished."
