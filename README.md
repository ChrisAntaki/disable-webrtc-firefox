Disable WebRTC, for Firefox
========================

[Install here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/happy-bonobo-disable-webrtc/)

WebRTC is a communication protocol that relies on JavaScript that can leak your actual IP address from behind your VPN, by default. This addon fixes that, making VPNs more effective [1].

This add-on allows you to easily disable WebRTC. You'll also be able to quickly toggle WebRTC back on/off by clicking the add-on's icon.

NOTE: Disabling WebRTC will break some sites that depend on it, like Google Voice. If you need to use those sites, here's a [suggestion from karlbright@](https://github.com/ChrisAntaki/disable-webrtc-firefox/issues/27#issuecomment-393377906): "the best solution for the foreseeable future is to either have another browser (perhaps firefox developer edition without this extension) used for those services, or enable WebRTC, and disable it again once finished."
