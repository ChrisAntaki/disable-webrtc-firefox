Disable WebRTC, for Firefox
========================

[Install here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/happy-bonobo-disable-webrtc/)

WebRTC is a communication protocol that relies on JavaScript that can leak your actual IP address from behind your VPN, by default. This addon fixes that, making VPNs more effective [1].

This add-on allows you to easily disable WebRTC. You'll also be able to quickly toggle WebRTC back on/off by clicking the add-on's icon.
